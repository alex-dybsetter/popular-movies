# popular-movies

movie database is pulled from The Movie Database API (https://www.themoviedb.org/).
A user can click on a movie poster and view a detail view of the movie's information, including
reviews and movie trailers that will launch in their web browser or the YouTube app. Users can also
save their favorite movies to a local SQLite database of their favorite movies.
